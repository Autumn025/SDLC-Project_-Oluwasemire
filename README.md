# SDLC-Project_-Oluwasemire
Student Result Management System (SRMS)
Project Overview
The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a Python-based console application developed as part of a Software Engineering (SEN) assignment. The system demonstrates the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirement analysis through implementation and testing.
The application manages student records, course information, and academic results using a simple, structured approach.

Preloaded Assignment Data
The system comes with the following preloaded data for demonstration and testing purposes:
•	Student ID: 24/13790
•	Student Name: LAOYE OLUWASEMIRE OLUWATIMILEHIN
•	Course Code: SEN 201
•	Course Title: Software Engineering
•	Result / Grade: A
All names and nomenclatures used in the system design are consistent with those used in the implementation, as required.

Features
•	Add new students
•	Add new courses
•	Record student results
•	View student results
•	Automatic grade handling

Technology Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Development Model: Waterfall SDLC
•	Interface: Console-based application

SDLC Implementation Summary
•	Requirement Analysis: Identified student, course, and result management needs.
•	System Design: Defined modules and data structures using dictionaries.
•	Implementation: Developed the system in Python with modular functions.
•	Testing: Performed manual testing using preloaded student data.
•	Deployment: Delivered as a standalone Python script.
•	Maintenance: System can be extended with databases, GUI, or authentication.
